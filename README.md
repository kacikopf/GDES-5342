# About Me! :)
Hi! My name is Kaci Kopf. I am a student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and minoring in User Experience. 
I am interested in all things creative, fitness, martial arts, and music. My goal is to become a UX designer, art director, or potentially a web developer!
